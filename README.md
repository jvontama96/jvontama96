Welcome! I'm Jevon, a former operational manager in the retail industry with 3 years of experience. I've decided to step out of my comfort zone and make a career shift into Data Science. Here, I’ll be publicly sharing my portfolio in Data Science and Data Analysis. I hope you find it beneficial. Enjoy exploring!
